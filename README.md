# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that identifies metastatic tissues in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections using a deep learning technique—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our goal is to classify cancerous tissues into two categories: Malignant (labeled as “1”) and Benign (labeled as “0”). This project seeks to understand the cancer detection process using a provided dataset, which consists of numerous small pathology images labeled as “1” or “0”.
